# Lab 0

Note: This lab is not relevant for the exam, but relevant to get you more familiar with the concepts in Python.

### Task 1:
Open the file `0_TicTacToe.py` and execute it with `python3 0_TicTacToe.py`.
It implements a tic tac toe game in which the human player uses a "x" symbol and the computer
player uses "o". Whoever has first three of its symbols in a row wins
(e.g rows can be horizontal, vertical or diagonal).

In the current state the game is not complete.
Your task is to finish the steps which are marked with "Task" to
finish the implementation of the game.

### Task 2:
Extend the program to let the player choose a flexible board size in the beginning
(Note: The board must always be of square dimension, e.g. 4x4, 5x5, etc.).
